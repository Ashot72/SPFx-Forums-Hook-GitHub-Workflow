# SPFx Forums Hook GitHub Workflow
I built a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (Workflows) for my SharePoint SPFx-Forums-Hook application. It will test, build, generate an SPFx package and deploy it to an organization tenantâ€™s App Catalog automatically. Our workflow uses third party actions, reusable workflows and composite actions.
