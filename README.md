I built a React Hooks based SharePoint SPFx forum. Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. You have 90% cleaner code with Hooks. The app uses React built-in, our custom and third-party hooks and shows how to use code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense.

You can download the package from [here](https://github.com/Ashot72/SPFx-Forums-Hook/tree/main/sharepoint/solution/react-forums-hooks.sppkg) and upload it to your Tenant App Catalog to run the forum.

To get started.
```
       Clone the repository

       git https://github.com/ashotik/SPFx-Forums-Hook
       cd SPFx-Forums-Hook

       # installs dependencies
       npm install

       # creates release package which should be deployed in SharePoint app catalog
        npm run deploy-prod
      
```
